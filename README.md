# AFC_Summary
Python tool for summarizing data availability along with useful metadata for ARM field campaigns.  The script runs off a configuration file, like those shown in the conf directory to produce these Gantt style charts.  In addittion to data availability, the code will also display associated DOIs on the chart or in a separate table.  Listing associated DQRs in a table is also an option. Updated documentation coming soon!

## Usage
python afc_summary.py -c ./conf/conf.py
